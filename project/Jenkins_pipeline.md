## Webhooks

Webhooks can be installed on repositories or organizations. They trigger on specific events - pull requests in our case, - sending a HTTP POST payload to a specified URL, triggering another event elsewhere.

## Installing Jenkins - on Linux Mint (optional; Jenkins can be run in a container, or HÃºli's instance may as well be used)

sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

sudo systemctl restart jenkins
