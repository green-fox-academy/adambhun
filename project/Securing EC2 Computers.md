# Accessing the instance

Use ssh to log into the instance. You might need an ssh client, like putty on Windows.
On Linux, open the terminal and enter a command like this:

```
ssh developer@ec2-3-121-229-207.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

where you should substitute "developer" for your username configured on the instance, and substitute the part after the "@" for the public address of the instance.
