//General way to execute commands:

  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "script.sh"
    destination = "/tmp/script.sh"
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "chmod +x /tmp/script.sh",
      "/tmp/script.sh args",
    ]
  }


//AWS

The user data field is idiomatic because it's native to AWS, whereas the remote-exec provisioner is specific to Terraform, which is just one of many ways to call the AWS API.
