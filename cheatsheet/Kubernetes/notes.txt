node - computer in k8s

cluster - effectivel one computer made up of many computers

persistent volume - volume connected to cluster, not node

pod - logical group of containers

deployment - replicaset with ability to update\rollback with no outage

daemonset - container that runs on every node

statefulset - replicaset with fixed name (foo1, foo2....)

configmap - settings for any pod in the cluster to subscribe to

kubectl client - kube-system gateway api. Access resources in your cluster with it, without having to set up a load balancer. Credentials: user: admin, pswd: kubectl config view --minify

Yyou should be able to ssh into any node in your cluster and curl both IPs. Note that the containers are not using port 80 on the node, nor are there any special NAT rules to route traffic to the pod. This means you can run multiple nginx pods on the same node all using the same containerPort and access them from any other pod or node in your cluster using IP. Like Docker, ports can still be published to the host nodeâ€™s interfaces, but the need for this is radically diminished because of the networking model
