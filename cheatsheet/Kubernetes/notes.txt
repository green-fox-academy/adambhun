Yyou should be able to ssh into any node in your cluster and curl both IPs. Note that the containers are not using port 80 on the node, nor are there any special NAT rules to route traffic to the pod. This means you can run multiple nginx pods on the same node all using the same containerPort and access them from any other pod or node in your cluster using IP. Like Docker, ports can still be published to the host nodeâ€™s interfaces, but the need for this is radically diminished because of the networking model


//DNS in k8s
//FQDN example
pod: database - IP ADDRESS database.namespace.svc.dluster.local
