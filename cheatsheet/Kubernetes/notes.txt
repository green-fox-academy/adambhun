node - computer in k8s

cluster - effectivel one computer made up of many computers

persistent volume - volume connected to cluster, not node

pod - logical group of containers

deployment - replicaset with ability to update\rollback with no outage

daemonset - container that runs on every node

statefulset - replicaset with fixed name (foo1, foo2....)

configmap - settings for any pod in the cluster to subscribe to

kubectl client - kube-system gateway api. Access resources in your cluster with it, without having to set up a load balancer. Credentials: user: admin, pswd: kubectl config view --minify

You should be able to ssh into any node in your cluster and curl both IPs. Note that the containers are not using port 80 on the node, nor are there any special NAT rules to route traffic to the pod. This means you can run multiple nginx pods on the same node all using the same containerPort and access them from any other pod or node in your cluster using IP. Like Docker, ports can still be published to the host nodeâ€™s interfaces, but the need for this is radically diminished because of the networking model


//DNS in k8s
//FQDN example
pod: database - IP ADDRESS database.namespace.svc.dluster.local

//service account
provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod.


//RBAC
role-based access control
//role is for namespace, clusterRole is for entire cluster. Likewise with RoleBinding

//resources
https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/kubernetes-best-practices-resource-requests-and-limits
//millicore
// a CPU core split into 1000 units
//mebibyte - MiB (can be something else too)
1024|2 bytes
//ECU
EC2 Compute Unit - standardied unit (~1.0 ghz Intel Xeon 2007)
//vCPU
the performance it represents depends on the instance t79pe
//requests
hint at what the container needs (pod allocation for node)
//limits
enforced @ runtime. Max CPU \ memory usage. exceeding memory limit leads to crash.
//limitRange
default value for limit in name
