For those who have trouble running "ts-node" in their GitBash command line on Windows OS.



1. Uninstall GitBash

2. Run the installation wizard and use the default settings except the one on the screen shot. You should choose "Use Windows' default command window"

3. Start up the newly installed GitBash and run 'npm install -g typescript' and wait for the installation.

4. Repeat step 3 with 'npm install -g ts-node'.

5. Voilï¿½...the command 'ts-node' should work now.
