Manage data in Docker

https://docs.docker.com/storage/

Volumes are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker (/var/lib/docker/volumes/ on Linux). Non-Docker processes should not modify this part of the filesystem. Volumes are the best way to persist data in Docker.

Bind mounts may be stored anywhere on the host system. They may even be important system files or directories. Non-Docker processes on the Docker host or a Docker container can modify them at any time.

tmpfs mounts are stored in the host system’s memory only, and are never written to the host system’s filesystem.


//HTTPS
Alpine doesn't have SSL certs, so HTTPS calls fail in an Alpine container.
Solution:
RUN apk update && apk add ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
