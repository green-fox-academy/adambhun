compile
runtime

semantic improper syntax(wrong side of expr, same names)
logical (makes no sense to humans) - div by 0

exceptions

why use them?
-exc error diff - break flow of program
-not within the (business)logic of the program
-obj - info - pass to runtime

-uniform way of handling errors (sy else's code)
-performance (server down)
-let the code know that sg unexpected happened (red flag)
-flow

exc types
-all are objects
-checked, compile time
-unchecked, runtime


terms
try-encaps
catch-block
throw-generate, describe
finally-always run
